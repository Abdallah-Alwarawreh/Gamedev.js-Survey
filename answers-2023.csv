Although I understand these technologies may help give a sense of novelty, monetization, and evolution in web games, but I still dislike the idea of involving players with cryptos or anything that makes them spend real money and potentially get scammed. Using games as a cover up to process the scheme.

Another issue in web game platforms is overpopulation. Gambling games, poor quality games (abandoned, unfinished, buggy or messy), and clones- not match-3 game clones that every uncle is playing, but games that came from open-source projects usually from GDevelop and github are being reuploaded in the platform without any changes from the source.","Game Jams are starting to become s#it. What happens to the honor system respecting the time frame?
Why are they releasing the theme too early if they could just add up the days in jam duration to give participants the time to come up with ideas?
Anyone will just use up premade projects or assets, or start early to get ahead of the competition. Like the BIGA game jam #2 releasing the theme immediately but requiring ""additional rule"" to prevent early starters. Then when it started, people showing off their Day 0 progress with complete core mechanics, multiplayer system, and polished games- like WTF? Who would not be discouraged after seeing those?
And you know what the BIGA Admin said?
""Nice progress.""
Whuuuuut? The hypocrisy of stating ""to prevent early starters"" in their page.
Of course, I quit the jam. Haha!"
